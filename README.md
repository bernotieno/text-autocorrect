# Text Transformer

Text Transformer is a command-line tool written in Go that processes text input, applies various transformations based on specified rules, and writes the modified text to an output file.

## Features

- **Number Format Conversion**: Convert hexadecimal and binary numbers to decimal.
- **Text Case Transformation**: Change the case of words to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize them.
- **Punctuation Adjustment**: Adjust the placement of punctuation marks in the text.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/).
